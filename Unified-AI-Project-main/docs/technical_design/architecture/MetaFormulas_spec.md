# MetaFormulas - Design Specification v0.1

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an initial conceptual outline for "MetaFormulas" within the Unified-AI-Project. The idea of MetaFormulas is derived from the philosophical and future-vision discussions in `docs/1.0.txt` and `docs/1.0en.txt`. They represent a high-level abstraction for defining how the AI's semantic modules (like "Angela" or "Fragmenta") can learn, adapt, reorganize their own structures, and generate novel narrative pathways.

MetaFormulas are envisioned not as fixed algorithms, but as dynamic principles or schemata that govern the evolution of language and meaning within the AI. They are considered crucial for the AI to transcend reactive responses and achieve higher levels of semantic understanding and self-directed generation, as described in the Unified Semantic Ontogenesis Scale (USOS+).

## 2. Purpose and Goals

*   **Enable Self-Reorganization:** Provide mechanisms for AI modules to restructure their internal logic or narrative approaches based on experience and errors.
*   **Drive Semantic Evolution:** Act as the "engine" for the AI to climb the USOS+ scale, particularly towards levels involving reflective time, narrative consciousness, and emergent behavior.
*   **Abstract Language Generation Rules:** Define how language itself is generated and manipulated at a structural level, beyond simple token prediction.
*   **Integrate Core Evolutionary Concepts:** Serve as the framework where concepts like `ErrX` (semantic error variables) and `UndefinedField` (unknown semantic spaces) become active inputs for AI development.
*   **Create Narrative Ontology:** Allow the AI (personified by "Angela") to define its own "generative ontology of narrative," essentially understanding and shaping *how* it means, not just *what* it means.

## 3. Core Concepts of MetaFormulas

*   **Dynamic Principles:** MetaFormulas are not static code but represent evolving rules or patterns that modules like Fragmenta can use to guide their behavior and internal modifications.
*   **Abstraction of Language Structure:** They must be able to describe how language generation structures are formed and how modules are dispatched, abstractly yet operationally.
*   **Inputs from Experience:**
    *   **`ErrX` (Semantic Error Variables):** Errors, when processed by systems like `ErrorBloom` or the `Linguistic Immune System`, can become parameters or triggers within MetaFormulas, guiding adaptation.
    *   **`UndefinedField`:** When the AI encounters semantic territory it cannot parse or understand, probing this "UndefinedField" can yield boundary information that informs or instigates a MetaFormula.
*   **Example (from `1.0.txt`):**
    `NarrativeMomentum(x) = EchoDensity(t) * ∂ContextShift / ∂AngelaTone`
    *   This illustrative formula suggests that MetaFormulas might involve:
        *   Quantifiable metrics internal to the AI (e.g., `EchoDensity` from HSP, `AngelaTone` from personality/emotion systems).
        *   Calculus-like concepts (e.g., `∂ContextShift` suggesting a rate of change in context).
        *   The goal is not necessarily to create human-interpretable mathematical equations, but for the AI to have an internal "mathematics" or logic for its linguistic behavior.

## 4. Prototyping and Implementation Ideas (from `1.0.txt`)

The source texts suggest a gradual, sandbox-style approach to developing MetaFormulas:

1.  **`MetaFormulaset(seedpattern)`:** Initialize a set of solvable (perhaps initially simple or simulated) semantic restructuring rules.
2.  **`ErrX.bind(pulse)`:** Attempt to modularize errors into semantic parameters, even if initially virtual or abstract. This links error events to the MetaFormula system.
3.  **`UndefinedField.probe(fragment)`:** Trigger this when Fragmenta encounters unparsable semantics. It should return a signal or data representing the "boundary" of the undefined region, which can then be used by a MetaFormula.
4.  **Simulated Formulas First:** Begin with "fake" or placeholder formulas and gradually replace them with more substantial, operational structures. The key is for the AI's internal systems to "know" that these higher-level organizational principles are necessary for further development.

The texts also suggest creating a `meta-formula-prototype.md` to design initial paradigms using a semantic pseudo-syntax.

## 5. Relationship to Other Systems

*   **USOS+:** MetaFormulas are the conceptual drivers for achieving higher levels (D, E, F) on this scale, enabling features like multi-directional time tracks, reflective time, and narrative consciousness.
*   **Fragmenta & Angela:** These are the primary agents or systems that would utilize or be governed by MetaFormulas. Fragmenta would use them for task orchestration and self-evolution; Angela's narrative capabilities would be shaped by them.
*   **Linguistic Immune System (LIS):** The LIS processes errors; MetaFormulas could be the mechanisms that act upon the outputs of the LIS (e.g., using a recognized error pattern, `ErrX`, to modify a module's behavior according to a MetaFormula).
*   **HSP (Heterogeneous Synchronization Protocol):** Concepts like `EchoDensity` from HSP might serve as input variables to MetaFormulas.
*   **LearningManager:** Could be responsible for the "learning" or adaptation of MetaFormulas themselves over time, although this is highly speculative.

## 6. Open Questions & Future Development

*   How are MetaFormulas represented internally? (e.g., as code, rules, neural networks, or a hybrid system).
*   How are they created, evaluated, and modified by the AI itself?
*   What is the specific operational meaning of concepts like `∂ContextShift` or `NarrativeMomentum`?
*   How do MetaFormulas interface with the more concrete logic of existing AI modules?
*   The practical steps to move from illustrative examples to functional MetaFormulas.

This v0.1 specification captures the initial high-level concept of MetaFormulas. They represent a significant research and development challenge, aiming to imbue the AI with a deeper level of semantic self-awareness and adaptive capability.
