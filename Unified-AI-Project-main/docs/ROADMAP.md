# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction of the Unified AI Project, collecting the "conceptual" and "future" features mentioned in the various design documents.

## Core AI

-   **`AIStateSynchronization`**: Implement a mechanism for AIs to share parts of their internal models or states. This will be a complex feature requiring a robust and secure implementation.
-   **`CapabilityNegotiation`**: Develop a system for AIs to negotiate the terms of a capability exchange, such as cost, quality of service, and data formats.
-   **Advanced Trust Management**: Incorporate Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a more sophisticated reputation system for more nuanced trust calculations.
-   **Consensus Algorithms**: Implement more advanced consensus algorithms for resolving conflicting information from multiple sources.

## HSP (Heterogeneous Service Protocol)

-   **Semantic Mapping/Translation Services**: Create a dedicated service for translating between different ontologies and data models, allowing for more seamless interoperability between agents.
-   **Distributed Ledger**: Use a distributed ledger to track critical transactions and AI reputations, providing a tamper-evident record of the network's activity.
-   **Standardized Error Code Ontology**: Develop a standardized ontology for error codes to improve error handling and debugging.

## HAM (Hierarchical Abstractive Memory)

-   **Semantic Embeddings**: Integrate sentence transformers or similar models to create richer semantic "gists" of memories, enabling more powerful similarity-based queries.
-   **Generative Reconstruction**: Use LLMs to elaborate on abstract gists, allowing for more detailed and human-readable memory recall.
-   **Multi-Modal Data Abstraction**: Define and implement abstraction methods for images, audio, and other non-textual data types.

## Agents

-   **More Specialized Agents**: Develop a wider range of specialized agents for different tasks, such as web research, code generation, and image manipulation.
-   **Agent Self-Improvement**: Implement mechanisms for agents to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time.
