# Unified-AI-Project: Content Organization

## Introduction

This document provides an organized overview of the Unified-AI-Project's content, categorizing key directories and files to aid in understanding the project's structure and the purpose of its various components. This is based on the file structure available as of July 8, 2024.

## 1. Root Directory Files

Key files at the project root:

*   `README.md`: Main entry point for project information, overview, setup, and contribution guidelines.
*   `MERGE_AND_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`: Documents the initial project structure, merge strategy, and architectural principles.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
*   `package.json`: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts for the project (e.g., for Electron app).
*   `.env.example`: Example environment variable file; a `.env` file should be created from this for local configuration.

## 2. Source Code (`src/`)

Contains the core Python source code for the AI and its services.

*   `core_services.py`: Provides central initialization (dependency injection) and access to core AI service instances. Responsible for instantiating and wiring together major components like DialogueManager, Memory, LLMInterface, etc.

### 2.1. Core AI Logic (`src/core_ai/`)

Houses the central intelligence and decision-making components of the AI.

*   **`dialogue/`**:
*   `dialogue/dialogue_manager.py`: Orchestrates conversation flow, integrates various AI components, and generates responses.
*   **`memory/`**:
    *   `ham_memory_manager.py`: Implements the Hierarchical Associative Memory for storing and retrieving experiences, learned facts, and dialogue context.
*   **`learning/`**:
    *   `learning_manager.py`: Coordinates the learning process, including fact extraction and storage.
    *   `fact_extractor_module.py`: Extracts structured facts from dialogue.
    *   `self_critique_module.py`: Evaluates AI responses for quality and coherence.
    *   `content_analyzer_module.py`: Aims for deep context understanding by analyzing text to create knowledge graphs (utilizes spaCy and NetworkX).
*   **`personality/`**:
    *   `personality_manager.py`: Manages different AI personalities and their profiles.

This differs from the HSP-specific capability discovery mechanism (expected to handle `HSPCapabilityAdvertisementPayload`, integrate with `TrustManager`, and have a `process_capability_advertisement` method) that is anticipated by `core_services.py` for HSP integration. This module requires refactoring or replacement to fulfill the HSP-related role.
