# This test file is a placeholder for future tests of the Electron application's
# integration with the Python backend services. Since the Electron app is primarily
# a JavaScript application, comprehensive UI and frontend logic testing would typically
# be done using JavaScript testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Playwright).
#
# Python-based tests here would focus on:
# 1. Verifying the Electron app's ability to communicate with the Python API server.
# 2. Testing the data exchange formats between the Electron app and Python services.
# 3. Mocking Electron app behavior to test Python service responses to its actions.

        # from the Electron app.
        self.assertTrue(True, "This is a placeholder test. Actual integration tests need to be implemented.")

    # Add more tests here as the Electron app's interaction with Python services evolves.
    # For example:
    # def test_electron_app_sends_query_to_api(self):
    #     with patch('src.services.main_api_server.process_query') as mock_process_query:
    #         mock_process_query.return_value = {"response": "Mocked AI response"}
    #         # Simulate Electron app sending a query (e.g., via a mocked HTTP client)
    #         # Assert that process_query was called with the correct arguments
    #         # Assert that the simulated response is handled correctly
    #     pass
