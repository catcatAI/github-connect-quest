# This test file is a placeholder for future tests of the Node.js backend services'
# integration with the Python backend services. Since the Node.js services are primarily
# JavaScript applications, comprehensive unit and integration testing for them would typically
# be done using JavaScript testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
#
# Python-based tests here would focus on:
# 1. Verifying the Node.js services' ability to communicate with the Python API server.
# 2. Testing the data exchange formats between the Node.js services and Python services.
# 3. Mocking Node.js service behavior to test Python service responses to its actions.

    #     with patch('src.services.main_api_server.process_data') as mock_process_data:
    #         mock_process_data.return_value = {"status": "success"}
    #         # Simulate Node.js service sending data (e.g., via a mocked HTTP client)
    #         # Assert that process_data was called with the correct arguments
    #         # Assert that the simulated response is handled correctly
    #     pass
